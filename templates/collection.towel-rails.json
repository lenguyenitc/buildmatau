They do their job of airing and storing your towel between uses, but are also a simple yet beautiful piece of furniture and decor. Towel rails typically come in single or double rails, and you can also invest in a heated towel rail. Towel rings are more popular for hand towels, but you can also use them for larger towels. Towel racks are similar to bathroom towel bars but typically have a series of bars instead of one or two bars. This is the ideal option for holding a number of towels separately. Towel ladders are flexible pieces of bathroom furniture you can lean up against the bathroom wall to store your towels.<\/p>"}},"1647899104ce551955-1":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"What is the warranty on Buildmat bathroom towel rails?","text":"<p>Buildmat offers a 7 year warranty on all of its bathroom towel rails for confidence and peace of mind.<\/p>"}},"4b2e74df-6403-4107-8845-4b65c22afc35":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Where is the Buildmat showroom?","text":"<p>Buildmat has both an online showroom where you can view our entire range, or an in-store showroom at 18 Babbage Dr, Dandenong South VIC 3175 Australia.
