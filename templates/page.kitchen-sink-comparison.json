The short answer is undermount if your budget allows for it, especially if you're looking at getting a stone bench. Unless you really don't want to be extra careful in the kitchen, if you know you're a clutz or you're always quickly trying to clean to get out of the kitchen as soon as possible then undermount might not be for you because over time the exposed benchtop can chip. If you're getting laminate or timber bench then you should most likely consider topmounting your sink.<\/p>"}},"accordion-item-6a4836e8-0189-11ed-b939-0242ac120002":{"type":"accordion-item","settings":{"heading":"Why Should I get a Sink with Thicker Steel?","text":"<p>You should get a thicker steel sink because they are more durable and last longer, as well as assist in lowering noise caused to read more of the benefits click on our article: Kitchen Sinks Made of Thick Stainless Steel<\/p>"}},"accordion-item-906c74ce-0189-11ed-b939-0242ac120002":{"type":"accordion-item","settings":{"heading":"Have more questions?","text":"<p>If you have any more questions, please feel free to ask us via sending an email to <a href=\"mailto:sales@buildmat.com.au\">sales@buildmat.com.au<\/a><\/p>"}},"accordion-close-5c476e70-0188-11ed-b939-0242ac120002":{"type":"accordion-close","settings":{}}},"block_order":["heading-230a4378-0181-11ed-b939-0242ac120002","accordion-open-bfb1d1d0-0188-11ed-b939-0242ac120002","accordion-item-10515b4c-0189-11ed-b939-0242ac120002","accordion-item-361dc4d2-0189-11ed-b939-0242ac120002","accordion-item-6a4836e8-0189-11ed-b939-0242ac120002","accordion-item-906c74ce-0189-11ed-b939-0242ac120002","accordion-close-5c476e70-0188-11ed-b939-0242ac120002"],"settings":{"content_width":800,"space_top":108,"space_bottom":108,"background_color":"#eceff0","custom_class":"section-faq-accordion"}},"design-options":{"type":"content-center","blocks":{"heading-4678fd7a-01b5-11ed-b939-0242ac120002":{"type":"heading-text","settings":{"heading_text":"A broad range of design options for your kitchen","space_bottom":61}},"grid-open-a681ac6c-fe93-11ec-b939-0242ac120002":{"type":"grid-open","settings":{"grid_columns":"3","gap_horizontal":32,"gap_vertical":32}},"image-box-2a28527a-01b9-11ed-b939-0242ac120002":{"type":"image-box","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/image-box-1.png","description":"Kitchen Build for Functionality"}},"image-box-ec9cb152-01b9-11ed-b939-0242ac120002":{"type":"image-box","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/image-box-2.png","description":"Stainless Steel Farmhouse Sink"}},"image-box-fdf9a4aa-01b9-11ed-b939-0242ac120002":{"type":"image-box","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/image-box-3.png","description":"Wooden Bench Designs"}},"image-box-0ba8ff9c-01ba-11ed-b939-0242ac120002":{"type":"image-box","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/image-box-4.png","description":"Corner Sink"}},"image-box-1a4b82ea-01ba-11ed-b939-0242ac120002":{"type":"image-box","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/image-box-5.png","description":"Corner Sink On L Island"}},"image-box-2ccb0f26-01ba-11ed-b939-0242ac120002":{"type":"image-box","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/image-box-6.png","description":"Clean Crisp Laundry Layout"}},"image-box-38773d72-01ba-11ed-b939-0242ac120002":{"type":"image-box","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/image-box-7.png","description":"Undermount Single Bowl Kitchen"}},"image-box-43a580be-01ba-11ed-b939-0242ac120002":{"type":"image-box","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/image-box-8.png","description":"Double Bowl Kitchen Layout"}},"image-box-50f32938-01ba-11ed-b939-0242ac120002":{"type":"image-box","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/image-box-9.png","description":"Island Bench Kitchen"}},"grid-close-b22f385e-01b5-11ed-b939-0242ac120002":{"type":"grid-close","settings":{}}},"block_order":["heading-4678fd7a-01b5-11ed-b939-0242ac120002","grid-open-a681ac6c-fe93-11ec-b939-0242ac120002","image-box-2a28527a-01b9-11ed-b939-0242ac120002","image-box-ec9cb152-01b9-11ed-b939-0242ac120002","image-box-fdf9a4aa-01b9-11ed-b939-0242ac120002","image-box-0ba8ff9c-01ba-11ed-b939-0242ac120002","image-box-1a4b82ea-01ba-11ed-b939-0242ac120002","image-box-2ccb0f26-01ba-11ed-b939-0242ac120002","image-box-38773d72-01ba-11ed-b939-0242ac120002","image-box-43a580be-01ba-11ed-b939-0242ac120002","image-box-50f32938-01ba-11ed-b939-0242ac120002","grid-close-b22f385e-01b5-11ed-b939-0242ac120002"],"settings":{"content_width":800,"space_top":128,"space_bottom":128,"background_color":"#eceff0","custom_class":"section-design-options"}}},"order":["main","page-landing-products","partner-brand-images","why-people-choose","section-product-specifications","customers-speak","faq-accordion","design-options"]}
